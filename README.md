# Hungry Hands Mobile Food Ordering App

Hungry Hands is a centralized campus app for CSUN students and faculty to order food (via pick up or delivery). This project will create opportunities for students to fulfill deliveries on campus in their free time. One of the goals our app strives to achieve is to build a community through student reviews and social interaction with corresponding restaurants.
